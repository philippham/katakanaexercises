A sorted array contains 6 different numbers, only 1 number is repeated five times. 
So there are total 10 numbers in array. 
Find the duplicate numbers using two comparisons only.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30}
Output: 1

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 9, 10}
Output: 3
